# Hi there! I'm Thien.

### About Me
I hold a PhD in condensed matter physics and am currently engaged in materials science research at a leading institution for materials science. My work focuses on the intersection of materials science, optical nanodevices and artificial intelligence, and I'm deeply interested in leveraging high-tech advancements to drive innovation in these fields. 

A lover of coding, Iâ€™m always exploring new technologies and techniques to enhance research efficiency and analysis. 

These repositories showcase a selection of public scripts and programs I've developed for my work. Feel free to explore, and letâ€™s connect to discuss innovative opportunities in the field.
